This post gives a quick walk through for steps to fix the GDB error : "remote 'g' packet reply is too long". 

If you already know the steps to patch, skip the rest of the article, the patch file is [here](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=8512).

This post serves to help those who are not familiar with the usual steps to apply patch and build from source. Steps are tested on Ubuntu 17.04.

### Step 0:
Remove existing GDB

```
sudo apt remove gdb
```

### Step 1:

Get the GDB source:

```
# Download the source archive
wget "http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb/gdb-7.11.tar.gz"

# Extract
tar -xzf gdb-7.11.tar.gz

cd gdb-7.11
```

### Step 2:

Download the patch file and apply it.

```
wget -O fix.diff "https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=8512"
patch gdb/remote.c fix.diff
```

### Step 3
You would need some packages to build (Skip if present, use appropriate package manager [command](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/package-management-basics-apt-yum-dnf-pkg#install-a-package-from-repositories) if using a different distro)
```
sudo apt install texinfo build-essential
```

Compile GDB and install it. This step might take few minutes.

```
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Done.
