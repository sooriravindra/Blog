After much contemplation, I finally set up a blog of my own and here it goes.

Watch out for some small tutorials, code nuggets and occasional reflections on life.

My target audience? Coders, students, geeks and ME! Yup, that's right, I often forget what I learn and what's better than teaching yourself?

Everything has a beginning and here is my blog's.
